# QI-Final-Project
Repository containing the final assignment for the course of Quantum Information. 

The assignment consist on finding the ground state energies for the Hesienberg spin chain in the presence of an external magnetic field. 
Two approaches are done:

- Lanczos method: an iterative and fast method for diagonalizing matrices.

- Variational Monte Carlo: starting from a Marshall-Jastrow variational wavefunction, the ground states energies are found by means of the variational principle.
